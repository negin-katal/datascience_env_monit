## How to use this repository

1. **Fork** it on GitHub (button at the top right). The fork is your own copy.
2. **Clone** your fork to your laptop and work there.
3. Follow the assignment sheet. Commit small, write messages that say why, and push to your fork.
4. Hand in what the assignment asks for on ILIAS.

Do not push to this repository. You work in your fork, so your changes never touch the course material.

## Before you start
